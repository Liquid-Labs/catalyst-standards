# Liquid Dev Documentation Standards

## Purpose & Scope

These standards address standards and best practices for documentation within the Liquid Dev framework.

## Terms

Within the scope of Liquid Labs products and technologies, the following should
be understood as follows:

* **inline documentation** is documentation embedded within source or configuration files
* **standalone documentation** is any documentation in a file which is purely documentation. In other words, not embedded within source or configuration files.
* **a standard** defines an objective, measurable objective which either *may*, *should*, or *must* be implemented to comply with the standards.
* **a guideline** provides guidance on how to understand and/or implement a standard.

## Standalone documentation types and formats

* MarkDown for text. TODO: expand.
* For UI.
* For types:
  * network diagram
  * software spec
  * general spec (like this)

## Standards

* Standards must be itemized with a single "standard statement" per line.
* Standards must be written "one rule per statement".
* GUIDELINE: In practice this means that most standard statements should consist of a single sentence. Standard statements include multiple sentences when it is cleaner or more clear to do so. Subsequent sentences may further specify or expand on prior statements.
* Each standard statement must include a single use of either 'may', 'should', or 'must' to indicate whether the standard is, respectively, optional, recommended, or required.
* Standard statements should use examples sparingly.
* Guideline statements should be embedded within the standards document and used in proximity to the standard statements they modify.
* 'Sub-standards' must be indicated as a clear sub-list nested under a single standard statement.
* GUIDELINE: A 'sub-standard' should always be written with the hyphen and understood as similar to a 'sub-task'. Do not confuse the concept with "substandard".
* A standard is considered met when all sub-standard statements are fulfilled, regardless of the sub-standard binding (? TODO: what's the term for the optional/recommended/required relationship ?)
